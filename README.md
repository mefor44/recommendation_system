# recommendation_system
Here I will develop recommendation system using python. The basic isdea is to explore some of the concapts and alhorithms that stay behind the recommendation systems like SVD, knn, RBM. First part of the project is done on MovieLens movie dataset, but finally I want to apply learned techniques to build recommender system for board games, based on BGG (boardgamegeek.com) data. I'm a big board game fan so although we don't change (board) games too often I'm still very eager to develop such a system.
